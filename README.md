# Port of shadcn/ui without Radix Depedency or any other UI library

This repository contains a port of the `shadcn/ui` library, a collection of UI components for web applications. The port is designed to have zero external UI dependencies and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. I added some minor additions and improvements like an affirmative variant and a Link component.
